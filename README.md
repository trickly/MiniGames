##Rock Paper Scissors
As it sounds, it is a rock, paper, scissors game.

##Apple Picker
A game to control a set of baskets across a screen and catch the falling apples.

##Remember that Rapper
This game is a memory-based matching game. There are a number of pairs of various rappers and they're all mixed in. Flip a card and try your best to remember the location of it as you flip through more and try to match it.

##Space Shooter
This game is based off the official Unity tutorial Shooter game. I decided to take it and tweak/play with it. You control a space ship and shoot the invading enemy ships. OFfers the most customization in the entire set of minigames.
